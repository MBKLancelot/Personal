    <h3 style="color: crimson"><em>Gear </em> <sup>Four</sup></h3>
    <p style="color: crimson;">Luffy has <i>three forms</i> of <b>Gear Four</b>. He first used Gear Four: <b>Bounceman</b> when he was fighting the monsters on the island in which he got trained 
        by the right hand man of the former <strong>King of Pirates</strong>, <small>Rayleigh</small>. It was later used on <del>Doflamingo</del> in Dressrosa. Gear Four: <b>Tankman</b> is also 
        one of the forms of gear 4. He used it against <del>Crackers</del> in Whole Cake arc. Gear Four: <b>Snakeman</b> was also first used in Whole Cake arc when Luffy was fighting <del>Katakuri</del>.</p>

    <h3 style="color: antiquewhite;"><em>Gear </em> <sub>Five</sub></h3>
    <p style="color: antiquewhite;"><b>Gear Five</b> was first used on <i>"The Strongest Creature"</i> Kaido. Gear Five, Nika Man also known as the Joyboy, was shown to us in episode 1071. 
        When all hope was lost, Luffy awakened his devil fruit which is the <strong>"Hito Hito No Mi, Model: Nika"</strong>. <ins>Eiichiro Oda</ins>, the writer of One Piece stated that Mangas were 
        getting very serious. He missed the old <em>"Eye-popping Animation"</em> and such. That's why he wanted Gear 5 to be "goofy". After all, the name is Joyboy, so he is supposed to bring
        joy to everyone. Gear Five is able to manipulate rubber on itself or its surroundings.</p>
